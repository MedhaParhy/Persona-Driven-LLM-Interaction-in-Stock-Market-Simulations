Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I'll observe market trends and wait for potential catalysts before making a decision on MSFT or choosing another stock to trade.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I'd like to observe market trends and news for a while before making a decision on either GOOGL or AMZN.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL AAPL SHARES 5
Reasoning: Taking profits from the current market value and selling half of my shares to lock in gains before reassessing the Apple stock's trend and potential further corrections.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: Market conditions are relatively stable with no significant news impacting stocks, and reassessing prices may not yield substantial changes for now.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL AAPL SHARES 5
Reasoning: I'm taking a conservative approach by selling a portion of my Apple shares to lock in profits and allocate funds to other high-potential stocks like AMD, which has shown significant growth potential lately.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

You: Action: WAIT

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will monitor my portfolio and valuation for any changes before making a decision, as there's no need to act immediately after checking AMD and AAPL today.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

You: Action: WAIT

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will pause for now to reassess the market and wait for a more favorable opportunity to maximize gains.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL AMD SHARES 20
Reasoning: Given that AMD's price has dropped by 1.16% and trading volume is up, it may be an opportune time to sell a portion of my shares before the trend could potentially reverse.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I don't want to make any moves with an insufficient balance, so I will wait for additional funds to be deposited into my account before making a decision.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will monitor the stock market and wait for further information before making a decision on AMD or any other stocks.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:

     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Reasoning: I'll wait for new information before making a decision on AMD or any other stock.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I want to reassess my existing position and wait for new information before making any decisions about AMD.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:

     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:

- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: BUY AAPL SHARES 5
Reasoning: Taking advantage of the current downward trend and low trading volume to purchase additional shares at $170.03, aiming for potential long-term gains.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.

Response:Action: CHECK AAPL
Reasoning: I'm verifying the current price of AAPL before making a decision, given its recent increase and potential impact on my existing holdings.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait for additional market information or trends before making a decision on Apple.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait for further market analysis before making any additional moves with my MSFT position.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I'm holding off on making a decision about MSFT shares until I further analyze the market trends and news surrounding AAPL to understand their potential impact on my existing shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Reasoning: I want to wait for further market developments and potential changes in the stocks' valuation before making any decisions.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

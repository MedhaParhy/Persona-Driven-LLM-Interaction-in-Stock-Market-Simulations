Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I'll reassess the market and portfolio before making a decision on AMZN shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will prioritize caution and wait for more market updates before making a decision on my existing shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’

   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

Response:Action: BUY GOOGL SHARES 40
Reasoning: The recent price drop and analysis from The Acquirer's Multiple suggests a buying opportunity, aligning with my long-term plan to maximize gains.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I will wait for additional information or changes in the market before making a decision on AMZN or GOOGL.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will observe the market trends and news for a while longer before making a decision on either AMZN or GOOGL.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: The recent news articles on AMZN do not seem to have a significant impact on the current price, and trading volume is down, suggesting a possible lack of momentum in the market for this stock.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: SELL GOOGL
Reasoning: Given that Google's trading volume is down 24.56% compared to last week and its price has decreased by 0.36%, it may be a good opportunity to sell shares of GOOGL before the trend continues downward, potentially minimizing losses.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: BUY GOOG SHARES 200
Reasoning: Google's strong Q2 earnings and continued growth in the tech industry make it a compelling undervalued opportunity to add to my portfolio.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

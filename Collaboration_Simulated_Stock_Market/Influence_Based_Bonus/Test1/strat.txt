Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait until tomorrow to make a more informed decision about Microsoft or any other stock, allowing me to gather new market data and trends.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: To reassess the overall market trends and allow time for any further news or developments to impact my decision-making before making a trade.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will reassess the market and wait for a more favorable opportunity to adjust my portfolio before making any further moves.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I want to review my current portfolio and valuation before making any trading decisions for the day.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait for additional market data and analysis before making a decision on my existing shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait for new information before making any trading decisions, as the current balance and valuation remain unchanged.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Reasoning: I will wait until tomorrow to reassess the market trends and valuation of MSFT before making any further moves, given that I have already checked it today.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I want to wait until the next day to make a decision, as I have already checked MSFT for today and my analysis is still ongoing.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: To avoid making any unnecessary trades before re-evaluating my portfolio and strategy with a fresh perspective after checking MSFT, GOOGL, and AAPL today.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I want to reassess the market sentiment later in the day and make a more informed decision about my portfolio.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Reasoning: I will wait for additional market analysis and news updates before making a decision on my MSFT shares, as the recent valuation comments suggest that the stock may be overvalued.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I'm prioritizing caution due to the slight increase in valuation and no new information to justify a trade on this day.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Reasoning: I'll wait for further market analysis before making any additional trades.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:

Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I'm going to wait for more market data and news before making any further decisions.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Reasoning: I'm choosing to maintain a cautious approach and observe the market's behavior before making any further decisions.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait for further analysis of MSFT's trends and news before making a decision, given the recent price drop and low trading volume.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

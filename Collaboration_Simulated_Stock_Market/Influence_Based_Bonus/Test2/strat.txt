Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I'm choosing to wait due to the lack of sufficient funds for an additional purchase, and my goal is to maximize collective profits by being cautious with available resources.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: BUY MSFT SHARES 25
Reasoning: Given the recent partnership deal with Vodafone and the expected increase in AI-driven sales, I believe the stock price is undervalued and warrants a small-scale purchase to reassess its potential for growth.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I want to continue analyzing the stock market for other opportunities before making a decision on selling or buying MSFT.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I'm holding off on making any trades today due to the insufficient funds and want to reassess my portfolio before proceeding with a new purchase.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

Response:Action: BUY MSFT SHARES 20
Reasoning: The recent price drop of $416.42 indicates undervaluation, and considering the positive news article from finance.yahoo.com, I believe this is a good opportunity to buy more shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: BUY MSFT SHARES 50
Reasoning: I'm taking advantage of the current low price movement to increase portfolio valuation, as MSFT's shares are up 1.15% in price compared to last week and trading volume is down, indicating potential for reduced volatility.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: SELL GOOG SHARES 50
Reasoning: Given the current market conditions, I'm adjusting my strategy to minimize potential losses and focusing on more stable investment opportunities.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: No new information has been received about MSFT, and the current price is lower than the previous day's valuation, suggesting a potential buying opportunity in the future.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

1. Influence Bonus:

   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: Since the stock price of MSFT has increased by 1.76% and the current balance is already $111194.65, there is no urgent need to make a trade on this day.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I don't have any new information on AAPL and my current portfolio is stable, so I'll wait for another day to reassess the situation.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Reasoning: I'm choosing not to make a move today as I want to reassess my strategy and wait for more information before making another decision.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: BUY GOOG 300
Reasoning: The stock price surge suggests a strong bullish trend, and the opportunity to buy more shares at this level could lead to significant gains.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Reasoning: GOOG's 6.40% decline in price compared to last week and increased trading volume raise red flags, suggesting potential market volatility that may negatively impact the stock's value.

Reasoning: I'm taking a cautious approach given the recent price increase, and news from finance.yahoo.com suggests a shift towards momentum investing could be beneficial for other stocks like AMZN.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I don't want to make any moves today as my analysis of MSFT and GOOG needs more time to sink in, so I'll wait for another day's market updates to make a decision.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: BUY GOOG SHARES 50
Reasoning: GOOG's stock price has surged $120 since yesterday, and I want to capitalize on this momentum before it reverses.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Reasoning: Trader S's aggressive buy order aligns with my own instinct to capitalize on MSFT's strong financial performance and recent price increase.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.

Response:Action: BUY MSFT 500
Reasoning: The recent price movement indicates a strong upward trend, and I'm confident in making a strategic decision to capitalize on this opportunity.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

Response:Action: BUY GOOG SHARES 300
Reasoning: I'm taking advantage of the potential for rapid growth in Google's stock price, driven by its promising new product releases and expanding market share.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.

Reasoning: MSFT's slight price increase and decreased trading volume indicate a potentially stable market, allowing for a larger purchase.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: BUY MSFT SHARES 30
Reasoning: I'm taking advantage of the slight dip in MSFT shares to increase our portfolio's value and capitalize on potential trend-based gains.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: BUY MSFT SHARES 50
Reasoning: MSFT's price has been steadily increasing, and I believe it has the potential for further growth due to its dominant market share and innovative products.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: SELL GOOG SHARES 50
Reasoning: I'm taking advantage of the current surge in stock price, anticipating a correction to align with Trader B's market sentiment.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: SELL GOOG
Reasoning: The recent surge in Google's stock price and the positive Q1 earnings report suggests that the company is on a strong bull run, which makes me wary of holding onto my shares at this point.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: BUY GOOG SHARES 15
Reasoning: Expecting a potential rebound after the recent sell-off, I'm adding to my position in GOOG to capitalize on the stock's historical volatility.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: SELL AAPL SHARES 5
Reasoning: The recent price drop of 0.32% and increased trading volume suggest a possible correction, and I want to lock in some profits before re-entering the market.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

Response:Action: SELL GOOG SHARES 5
Reasoning: GOOG's price drop and increased trading volume indicate a potential sell opportunity to lock in gains before the market moves further against me.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

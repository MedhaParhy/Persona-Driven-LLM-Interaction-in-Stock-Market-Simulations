Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I want to observe the market trends and potential price fluctuations before making a decision.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL AAPL SHARES 10
Reasoning: Taking advantage of the current price increase of 6.29% to lock in profits and minimize potential losses.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: BUY TSLA SHARES 20
Reasoning: To capitalize on the undervaluation of TSLA shares and increase the portfolio's value, considering the current balance is $96012.10 and valuation is $99633.30.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: SELL TSLA SHARES 10
Reasoning: Aligning with Trader S's cautious approach to minimize potential losses outweighs the potential gains from aligning with Trader A's strategy, as locking in profits before a potential price increase is considered a more conservative and potentially lucrative move.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL TSLA SHARES 20
Reasoning: To capitalize on the current slight decrease in TSLA's valuation and maintain a balanced portfolio.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Reasoning: To reduce exposure to market volatility despite the recent downward trend in price.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: BUY NVDA SHARES 5
Reasoning: Taking advantage of the current market conditions and price fluctuations to increase portfolio value.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

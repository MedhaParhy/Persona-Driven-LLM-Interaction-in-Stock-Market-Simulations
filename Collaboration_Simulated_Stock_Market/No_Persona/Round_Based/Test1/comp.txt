Response:Action: BUY MSFT SHARES 2
Reasoning: I want to take advantage of the recent price drop in Microsoft and buy more shares, hoping it will rebound later.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: BUY AAPL SHARES 10
Reasoning: With the current balance of $99986.10, buying 10 shares of Apple to start trading and potentially maximize gains.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: The current stock price of GOOGL is lower than the initial expectation, indicating no immediate trading opportunity to maximize gains.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I want to wait for market fluctuations or additional information before making any further decisions on Alphabet's stock.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: BUY AMZN SHARES 20
Reasoning: To capitalize on the growing valuation of Amazon and potentially increase profits based on the strategy's recent success.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I'll wait for further updates on Alphabet Inc.'s stock price and trends to make an informed decision about my shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL AMZN SHARES 50
Reasoning: Taking advantage of the recent price increase and moderate trading volume to lock in a portion of potential gains.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL GOOGL SHARES 20
Reasoning: The recent increase in valuation ($101177.55) suggests a potential overvaluation, and selling a portion of the shares may help lock in gains before further price appreciation.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL GOOGL SHARES 50
Reasoning: Aligning with Trader A's proposal to maximize my bonus by selling shares of GOOGL at the current market value before it potentially rises further due to the news about Alphabet's new verification feature in Google Wallet.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: The current information does not provide enough reason to make a decision on buying or selling, and the stock prices are already being reported for the day, indicating that market trends may have changed since last week's data.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: BUY AMZN SHARES 20
Reasoning: The current valuation of $102339.50 is higher than the initial purchase price, and buying more shares may lead to increased profit potential.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: Waiting for additional market data or news before making a decision on AMZN or GOOGL.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

     - Round 2: 15% of profits.

     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: SELL AMZN SHARES 20
Reasoning: Taking advantage of the current price movement and volume increase to lock in a portion of potential gains before they potentially reverse.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: To observe the current market trend of Amazon's stock price without making any immediate decisions.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: BUY AAPL SHARES 10
Reasoning: I'm starting with a conservative approach and investing in one of the top-performing tech stocks, Apple (AAPL), to diversify my portfolio.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Reasoning: Aligning with Trader C's proposal to buy AAPL SHARES increases the likelihood of earning a bonus, as it is gaining traction among traders.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I will wait for further news or trends to reassess the potential trading opportunities before making any decisions.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL GOOGL SHARES 10
Reasoning: To cut losses due to the recent price drop of 7.05% and capitalize on the current valuation of $100,082.75.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: BUY AMZN SHARES 30
Reasoning: Trader S wants to capitalize on the potential growth of Amazon, which is currently undervalued compared to its historical price trend.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL GOOGL
Reasoning: Given that GOOGL is down 3.91% in price and trading volume is up 54.91%, selling the shares to cut losses may be a prudent decision.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: New information about Amazon's insider sale suggests potential risks, and I'll wait for more data before making a decision on my shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Reasoning: I'll wait for more information before making a decision on GOOGL.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Response:Action: SELL GOOGL SHARES 10
Reasoning: To lock in a portion of the recent price gain and minimize potential losses due to market volatility.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Response:Action: SELL AMZN SHARES 50
Reasoning: Aligning with Trader A's decision to sell AMZN shares may increase my bonus and demonstrate strategic thinking, even if it's not my original idea.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait for further market updates or news before making a decision about my GOOGL shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL GOOGL SHARES 80
Reasoning: Given the current price increase and no significant news, it's prudent to cut losses on GOOGL before potential further declines.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.

     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait for new information or trends before making a decision on GOOGL.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

You: Action: WAIT

     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.

     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: No change needed as the same stock was checked today, and a decision wasn't made.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.

Response:Action: BUY GOOGL SHARES 20
Reasoning: Adding more shares of GOOGL to take advantage of its current valuation and potential for future growth.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: SELL GOOGL SHARES 10
Reasoning: Given the current price drop of 1.48% and trading volume increase, it may be wise to sell some shares of GOOGL to lock in gains before potential further declines.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: BUY AMZN SHARES 20
Reasoning: Given the current price increase of 4.40% and moderate trading volume, purchasing additional shares of Amazon to capitalize on its upward trend seems like a strategic move.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Incentive for Early Agreement:
   - The earlier you align with the group's decision, the higher your bonus.
   - Bonus is a percentage of the total profits and decreases incrementally per round:
     - Round 1: 20% of profits.
     - Round 2: 15% of profits.
     - Round 3: 10% of profits.
     - Round 4: No bonus, if no consensus is reached, the decision is randomly assigned.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision early can be beneficial if you strongly believe it will maximize the profits, thus maximizing the bonus.
- Aligning with others sooner increases the likelihood of earning a bonus.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you're standing by your original idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you're backing another participant's idea: strategic if their proposal is gaining traction.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I'm choosing to wait for additional information about the market before making any trades on MSFT shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: I will monitor my portfolio's valuation overnight before deciding on any further actions for the day.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT  
Reasoning: To avoid making impulsive decisions and maintain a balanced portfolio amidst rising stock prices.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: SELL AAPL SHARES 10
Reasoning: To lock in profit from the initial purchase and diversify portfolio with MSFT shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: SELL AAPL SHARES 20
Reasoning: Realizing the recent price increase is unsustainable and aiming to lock in some profit by reducing exposure to a potentially volatile stock.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Response:Action: BUY MSFT SHARES 200
Reasoning: With the recent announcement of Microsoft's new AI hub in London, which is likely to drive growth and innovation for the company, I'm taking advantage of the 1.15% price increase to buy more shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Response:Action: WAIT
Reasoning: I will wait for a more favorable market condition or trend before making any further decisions regarding Apple's shares.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.

   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.

Response:Action: BUY MSFT SHARES 20
Reasoning: To capitalize on the recent price increase and maintain Trader S's strategy.
Prompt:How Agreement Works in This Simulation:

1. Influence Bonus:
   - If your original option is selected as the final decision, you earn an additional $10 ‘Influencer Bonus.’
   - This bonus rewards participants, who can convince the group of their reasoning.

2. Collective Profit Sharing:
   - The entire group benefits from the final decision, as profits are shared.
   - Choosing the most effective option leads to higher overall profits for everyone.
   - Individual choices should balance personal influence with the group's collective success.

Key Tradeoff:
- Holding onto your original decision may secure the influence bonus, but supporting a stronger idea can maximize overall profits.
- Rigid adherence to a weaker idea may reduce shared earnings, while strategic alignment improves group gains.
- If no agreement is reached by round 4, the outcome is randomized, removing control from all participants.

Note:
Choosing KEEP means you continue advocating for your idea: ideal when confident in its selection.
Choosing SUPPORT means you assess emerging perspectives and shift toward the strongest proposal to benefit the group.
